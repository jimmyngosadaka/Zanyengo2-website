      <h2>Zanyengo Trustee Foundation</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Zanyengo Trustee Foundation is a community-focused organization established to
support development and welfare in Chasefu and Mambwe Eastern Province. Formed
on 5 February, 2024. A dedicated
environmental organisation committed to combating climate change and promoting sustainable practices in Zambia. 
. <i>Zanyengo Trustee Foundation</i> is a youth led 
organisation registered under PACRA as a non-profit making organization. The organisation operates
from Mambwe and Chasefu Districts of Eastern Province.<br>
<br>

Zanyengo Trustee Foundation is run by a passionate group of youths determined to make a significant difference in their
 community. As an organisation, we believe in fostering a sustainable and environmentally conscious community. Through 
 education, innovation, and active participation, we strive to mitigate climate change, promote sustainable practices, 
 and ensure a healthier future for Zambia and beyond. <br>
<br>
The organisation focuses on combating climate change through sustainable ways which are afforestation, waste management
 and forest management. Currently Zanyengo Trustee Foundation has secured a forest place close to 200,000 hectares in 
 Chasefu District and is in the process of completing the formation of the Community Forest management Groups (CFMG). Through this 
 project, Zanyengo intends to work close with the community as a way of securing buy in for their involvement in the 
 protection of the forest. Currently, Zanyengo is also leading on a waste management project in Mambwe District. <br>
<br>
<br>
Zanyengo Trustee Foundation is a newly formed organisation who had its first encounter with the Zambian Governance
 Foundation in May 2024 through the review process for the Civil Society Challenge Fund. Despite not being selected for 
 funding, ZGF was impressed with what the organisation had presented. As part of organisational strengthening support, 
 Zanyengo was considered for strategic support in partnership with SGS Consulting, South Africa. The support was aimed at
  supporting the organisation to build itself strategically and position itself in the climate change sector.
   An independent consultant was assigned to the organisation to provide guidance and support in the development of the 
   strategic plan that would give them more ground and leverage for further strategic engagement with more funding and 
   non-funding partners and amplify their strategic picture on what they intend to do as an organisation.

          <p>Climate change, driven primarily by human activities such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation, 
            has significant impacts on both the environment and human health. Deforestation leads to increased greenhouse
             gases, soil erosion, disrupted water cycles, and loss of biodiversity. ZTF is dedicated to reversing
            these trends through strategic initiatives aimed at restoring forests and promoting sustainable land use.</p>

            impacts. By educating communities and implementing sustainable waste management systems, ZTF aims to reduce 
            greenhouse gas emissions and promote a cleaner environment.</p>
